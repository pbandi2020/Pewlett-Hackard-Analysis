### Results
* **Retirement Title**  - The goal of this output was to build a table named Retirement_Title using the employee and titles table structure. 

                                                                                                                                                                     
### Summary
Looking at the above statistis it is clear that **Urban City Typ** has a higher operations when compared to other two city types. Even though the Urban city type is showing the highest fares, when comparing the trends between the 3 City Types all three types are consistent across all months based on the respective ride and drive count. Based on this **I recomment to increase the operations in other 2 cities to see a higher fairs**.
